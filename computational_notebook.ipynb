        "This webtext is a pedagogical tool that supports students, teachers, and researchers in writing studies and allied fields who are interested in gaining a beginner-friendly introduction to the computer language Python. Specifically, this webtext consists of a computational notebook, which is a web interface that weaves together multiple modalities of HTML markup, written text, and coding snippets to provide an interactive experience with computer code. The written text in this interface helps users navigate, run, and edit the code snippets and engage with their outputs. By using this webtext, users will develop an ability to read basic code in Python—which is arguably one of the most widely used computer languages today and has played a major role in the development of practices like data science and artificial intelligence, which are rapidly impacting the field of digital rhetoric. Since computer code, especially that which is written in Python, plays a key infrastructural role that undergirds many forms of writing, rhetoric, and culture in our digitally mediated worlds, developing basic literacy in it can enable us to cultivate a critical awareness of our digital lives. You can use this tutorial independently or integrate it into a classroom setting.\n"

        "\n",
        "To make it possible for you to read this sentence, many networks of humans, hardware devices, and computer code are currently working together. Human writers composed and edited this text using a keyboard, which then sent those keystrokes to their computers’ CPU. The CPU then converted those keystrokes into binary data and saved them in the computer’s memory and registered them as visual characters on a screen. The editors of this journal then took that data from the authors, edited it, and saved it on their server. When you clicked on the hyperlink for this page, your computer’s network sent a request to access that data from the journal’s server. After being granted permission, the journal’s server sent the data to your computer. Your computer then converted that binary data into pixels and sent it to your monitor. Finally, your monitor lit up in accordance with protocols on how to display those pixels as visual stimuli, making the text readable to your eyes or your screen readers.\n",
        "Without computer code mediating each of these steps, much modern communication would be unimaginable. This is what Anette Vee alludes to when she talks about the infrastructural role that computer code plays in shaping contemporary communication:\n",
        "\n",
        ">..throughout much of the world, computer code is infrastructural: layered over and under the technology of writing, computer code now structures much of our contemporary communications, including word processing, e-mail, the World Wide Web, social networking, digital video production, and mobile phone technology. Our employment, health records, and citizenship status, once recorded solely in text, are now cataloged in computer databases” (Vee, 2017, p. 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "Many scholars in digital rhetoric have helped us understand that this infrastructural role is not a passive, objective, or neutral form of mediation, but rather it plays an active rhetorical role in shaping meanings in our digital public spheres (e.g., Ingraham, 2014; Beck, 2016; Brock and Shepherd, 2016). For example, Laquintano and Vee (2017) show that fake news can be spread through the use of automated writing algorithms, or ‘bots’ on social media. A bot is any computer program that can automate repetitive tasks typically done by humans. While bots can be used across domains and can be helpful or harmful, Laquintano and Vee (2017) refer to specific kinds of malicious social media bots that are used by their programmers to appear to be real, human users. Such bots can assist in amplifying fake news articles or even just making certain positions seem more legitimate, thereby helping skew public discourse in certain ideological directions. During the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, many social media bots had played an active role in influencing public opinion in this manner (Boichak et al., 2016). To be a mindful social media writer, Laquintano and Vee (2017) argue, it is important to understand what bots are and the infrastructural role that their algorithms play to amplify or constrain different types of discourse. Such knowledge can also help writers generate counter-rhetorical practices. Lussos (2018), for instance, teaches her students how to customize existing coding templates to create Twitter bots that help raise awareness about social problems in the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social media bots are one case, but countless others—like the growing emergence of data science and generative artificial intelligence in our digital lives—have made it important for writers as well as for scholars and teachers of writing and rhetoric to have a basic working knowledge of how computer code shapes their communication. While we have a lot of scholarship in digital rhetoric and writing studies that analyzes the rhetorical role of computer programs, unfortunately we do not have enough pedagogical resources to aid in onboarding new scholars, teachers, and writers unfamiliar with how computer code works. There have been some commendable efforts by digital rhetoricians like Quigley (2022), Lindgren & Ridolfo (2020), and others to create such resources. Our tutorial aims to contribute to these ongoing efforts by, providing a novice-friendly and easy-to-use introduction that will help readers develop a basic reading comprehension of computer code in Python. It is important to remember though that the goal of this web text is to assist in basic reading comprehension of Python, not necessarily a level of production-level literacy. We have specifically chosen Python as our language of choice because of its relatively user-friendly syntax and wide applicability, especially in areas of digital writing that interest scholars of writing studies, rhetoric, and allied fields.\n",

        "In what follows, we will begin by introducing  some definitions in Part 3.. Then, in part 4, we provide guidance on how to use a computational notebook in Google Colab. In part 5, we move to the meat of the matter and teach you how to read Python code. To do this, we first share sample Python code we created to provide a hypothetical example of how students’ instructor reviews can get analyzed computationally in certain administrative settings. We then explain what is happening in the code through detailed explanations of foundational symbols and concepts in Python. We end this section by reflecting on the kinds of rhetorical and interpretive readings of this code a basic coding literacy would enable for digital rhetoricians. We conclude by offering resources for readers interested in growing these skills further.\n"

        "### 3.1 Code and Coding\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, we want to set out some definitions and practices to be clear about what we mean when we talk about “code.” The very first point we would like to make is that all computer code is a form of writing. At the very basic level, computer “code” many different technical languages that have been composed over the last 100-150 years to help human users interact with computers. As rhetoricians, this meaning of “code” is not the only one that we come across in our daily work. Many of us might be more familiar with a different kind of “coding” typically used in qualitative research. In such cases ‘code’ is the identification of, and subsequent execution of, specific content that falls into some kind of classification system or bucket-grouping that provides evidence of a certain kind of outcome<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>. Users develop a ‘code book’ or shared vocabulary of activity to track across multiple sources. This kind of qualitative coding can be done manually, or might require software such as NVivo or Atlas.ti to perform qualitative content analysis or discourse analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to signpost this distinction at the very beginning to avoid confusion between computer coding and qualitative coding. Qualitative data coding is a major methodological intervention in the social sciences and humanistic disciplines. We do not wish to dismiss qualitative analysis - in fact, you can use computer programming languages to perform qualitative analysis. Both definitions of “code” can in fact invoke the use of software or computer programming languages that have certain capacities that provide engagement points between the computer and the user. However, when we discuss code in this piece, we want to be clear that we are using “code” as a shorthand for any text written in a computer programming language to directly “speak” or “converse” with your computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Our language of choice is the programming language Python. We focus on Python because it opens many opportunities for you to continue to hone your skills as a quantitative and qualitative researcher. Among other things, Python is an open-source, well-maintained programming language with an emphasis on readability<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>.  R, another common open-source programming language, has more of a focus on statistical computing and data visualization<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>. Plenty of Python (and R) materials are already available as open educational resources, and working with computational code in research contributes to the larger open source movement. We like Python because it is lightweight and flexible, and it has the benefit of looking rather like English. This is a general plus for English-language readers and speakers - the code as written should not look intimidating or wildly foreign to us, even if it does not always follow the logic or structure of everyday English language<sup>[4](#fn4)</sup>. This is also a good moment to note that Python is not a natural (i.e. spoken) language, though it has its own internal logic and sets of rules in a way that make it like a spoken language. Additionally, since Python is also widely used by those working with data science and artificial intelligence, we hope that developing a working knowledge of it could also help digital rhetoricians engage more critically with the AI community, which has been marked as an important concern by many scholars of writing studies and rhetoric recently (Gallagher, 2023; Byrd, 2023).  \n",
        "\n",
        "We offer this web-text as a means to introduce the foundations of computer programming in Python that have been adapted for a writing studies audience. Some readers may recall the early days of the personal computer, such as MS-DOS, a predecessor to the modern Windows operating system. Working with Python or other coding languages is very similar to MS-DOS - there is an input screen, and each step to accomplish something must be provided by the user. While this may feel tedious, it also offers the user profound opportunity to be as exact as they want to be—not dissimilar to other forms of composition. Lindgren (2021), in fact, notes that several scholars position code as “the first form of writing that does what it says with great precision” (p. 117). Thus, we find that coding languages offer the ability to be more direct in manipulating data to do precisely what you want while also ensuring greater reproducibility by sharing the exact steps you took to conduct an analysis, including through computational  notebooks like this (more on computational notebooks in the next part) and code repositories such as GitHub. The ability to share, remix, and otherwise adapt extant code is one of the strongest benefits of working with code, along with the capacity for someone to follow along with the steps you took to conduct an analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In what follows, we begin by introducing readers to operating within what is called a “computational notebook,” which hosts and allows users to engage with code in an interactive way. We will offer an overview of how to interact with this notebook, including “running” (i.e. operationalizing) code and observing what it does. Once we establish how to use this resource, we will next introduce the main building blocks of reading Python code. In both instances, we are not seeking to provide a complete dictionary of all ways one may encounter Python, or to cover the large universe of what Python can do, but we do aim to situate our readers with some immediate sense of how to read or otherwise interpret some of the key pieces of Python’s symbols and syntax, which ultimately define different kinds of activities. Much like signposts in prose, these skills-building and vocabulary-building activities are designed to help the reader understand what will happen in the near future.\n"

We spent some time defining what we mean by “code,” “coding,” and “Python” and what our expectations for you, the reader, are. One of the more alien-seeming aspects of interacting with your computer with text in the 2020s is that we have lost a lot of engagement with the “under the hood” model of providing commands. Graphic user interfaces have made it more difficult to see, and subsequently interact with, a command line interface (the black screen that is familiar to coders but everyday users might have only encountered it when their Windows or Mac OS breaks down and need re-installing). For those of you who are used to hardware like a cell phone or a tablet, it can be more difficult to imagine that there is an underlying language to every action you take on your device. However, this is still a crucial piece of computational infrastructure. In this part, we will help you peek under the hood a little bit so let us begin!\n",

Sentiment is typically measured as an overall score attached to a fragment of text, with positive scores indicating “positive” sentiments like good, happy, and favourable (among others) and negative scores indicating “negative” sentiments like bad, sad, and unfavourable (among others). Since the internet is full of trillions of user comments on products, discussion forms, social media and other digital spaces, sentiment analysis has grown to perform a key audience analysis function for businesses, politicians, policymakers, social media moderators, and similar domains.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Typically, Python code is written using two kinds of ‘sentences’ or ‘sentence fragments.’ One is called a line of code or a coding statement, which tells the computer what to do, usually marked in black. The second, a comment which tells human readers what the code means, usually marked in green and starting with a “#”. The # symbol tells the computer to ignore the immediate sentence after this character and is primarily used to notate a comment or description of what happens in subsequent the code for human readers. Both of these are text-based, with the capacity of containing semantic and rhetorical meaning. Let’s look at a sample Python coding statement from our example above to understand how these basic ideas work:\n"

        "In the example above, we see first that there is a comment, which reads ‘# A student review of a teacher’. Note that the “#” is what marks this as a comment. This comment offers a summary of what comes next to human readers of the code. What follows next, which looks a lot like an equation, is what would be called a coding statement and is meant to be processed by the computer. It may look to you like an equation, like in algebra class. Such coding statements can be used for various purposes, most importantly, to define *variables*, store different types of data in them, and to write *functions* that perform complex operations on that data. When you run the code cell above, you are saving the sentence \"The course was challenging...\" into a *variable* called \"review.\" Let us look at how this happens in a little more detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. Variables and Types of Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In algebra, one often writes sentences like “x = 5” to create a *variable* or placeholder titled “x” and assign it a value of “5” with the equals sign. A lot of computer code follows a similar syntax to create *variables* where different types of data can be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example above, we have what appears to be a complete sentence, bounded by quotes: “The course was challenging and the professor was intense but I learned a lot and don’t feel intimidated any more.” This sentence is preceded by the word ‘review,’ and the two are connected by an equals sign. Like in algebra, we are introducing a *variable* that we are naming “review” , and we are assigning it a certain textual value that is defined by whatever comes after the equals sign. *Variables* are shorthand for larger amounts of content, so that we can refer to it in our code more easily. We use the equals sign (=) to store this information, so here we are saving the sentence “The course was challenging and the professor was intense but I learned a lot and don’t feel intimidated any more” to the *variable* “review.” Typing “review” is much faster than typing out this sentence! In more advanced code you may find that the *variable* may be a letter, like “x” in a lot of algebra, or a shorthand abbreviation for a larger name. The way you choose your variable names is entirely up to you, but for ease of memory, you may want to keep them simple and easy to remember.\n",
        "\n",
        "While choosing a *variable* name is relatively open to coders’ choices, other types of syntactic choices, like using an equals sign (=) when creating *variables* and storing data in them, are pre-determined and cannot be changed. All computer languages have pre-defined syntax based on which coding statements become meaningful. Using an equals sign (=) to define *variables* and store different types of data in them is a syntactical norm that the creators of Python developed. All computing languages use *variables* for the same purpose, which Bostroem et al. (2016) associate with the image of a sticky note. They write that “assigning a value to a *variable* is like putting that sticky note on a particular value” (n.p.). But different languages many have different syntax for defining and storing *variables*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most computer languages, including Python, allow us to save a wide range of types of data within *variables*. For this lesson, we need to learn about two basic types of data in Python: *integers* and *strings*. We could save the number “5” in a *variable* we call “x” and that would be an example of an *integer* data type. The second datatype called *string* specifically refers to a *string* or chunk of textual characters. Such *strings* can have meanings that are sensible to human readers, or they could be a collection of meaningless, random textual characters too. The sentence that we saved in the *variable* “review” would be an example of a *string*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we that we have an understanding of *variables* and the different types of data that can be stored in them, let’s move on to the next part of our coding example.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next step, we build a thesaurus of sorts to analyze the language in the review. The comment (marked by the # symbol) describes the activity: we’re choosing words to apply being representative of ‘negative’ sentiments. Like before, we are seeing *variables* being assigned a meaning. This time our *variables* are \"negative_word_1,\" \"negative_word_2,\" and so on.\n"

        "Apart from storing different types of data in *variables*, the other major use of coding statements is to create something called *functions* which allow us to perform complex analytic operations on the data we have stored. A *function* is a series of commands or coding statements that perform certain actions on a given set of data, and which can be packaged together with a name so that it becomes easier to reuse. It is essentially “a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code” (Bostroem et al., 2015, n.p.). The really powerful thing about *functions* is that while we can create *functions* of our own, we can also borrow those that other coders have already created and shared with the world, in a way similar to how we borrow academic ideas from scholars that we read and engage with. One such *function* that is used in the coding example above is something called the “count” *function*.\n",

We helped you interact with the code pieces directly and provided a step-by-step description of each part of the process. We introduced and defined several major components of the Python coding language - *variables*, *data types*, *functions*, and *if/else* logic statements- to illustrate how Python operates with a real-life example. This has the benefit of showing how each ‘sentence’ of the code works, both in a textual and interactive format.\n",

        "Through our example and ensuing explanation, we have introduced you to not just some basics of computer coding in Python, but also to something that goes by various names in computing circles like “algorithmic thinking” (Futschek, 2006) or “computational thinking” (Wing, 2006,) or even “proceduracy” (Vee, 2010).\n",
        "\n",
        "This set of overlapping skills involves the “ability to analyze a given problem, [...] find basic actions that are adequate to it, construct an algorithm” (Futschek, 2006, p. 160) which is a set of well-defined steps or small-procedures that would help solve it, and “then express—or \"write\"—those procedures in a standard format that may be \"read\" by a non-human entity such as a computer” (Vee, 2010, p. 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "Such computational ways of thinking are an essential part of “coding literacy” (Vee, 2017) and can help digital rhetoricians and compositionists better understand and analyze the rhetorical role that digital media and their underlying substrate of computer code play in the world. In our example, we showed one of the ways in which the problem in front of us—how to analyze student reviews—could be solved computationally. There are many other ways in which different algorithms and coding solutions could’ve been written to address the same problem. Each computational procedure that we chose in our solution, and each line of code that we wrote to implement those procedures, involved rhetorical choices which shaped the results that finally emerged. We discuss this in more detail in the next section below.  \n"

        "### 5.3 Rhetorical Interpretations of Sample Python Code\n",
        "\n",
        "In section 5.1, we used an example of a brief Python program that evaluates student reviews of teachers as positive or negative. We  chose an activity that is specifically relevant to someone in a teaching environment, as we know that student reviews of instructors are often collected at the end of a semester. Although our example only looks at one student’s review, one can imagine that it would be possible to aggregate all the students’ reviews from a specific class for this process. And doing such an analysis has real-world implications – for example, if you were an administrator, and you were using a software that uses our two lists of pos_words and neg_words, it is possible that some reviews could get mis-classified as negative based on how certain vocabulary might be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our example shows how our program classifies the sample review as negative - “The course was challenging and the professor was intense, but I learned a lot and don’t feel intimidated anymore.” While the review contains words like “challenging,” “intense,” and \"intimidated\" that in isolation might seem negative, when we see how they are used in context in the sentence, it is easy for human readers, especially those of us who are teachers, to understand that the student is actually appreciating rather than criticizing the teacher. Our Python program however is based on an algorithmic choice where individual words are used in isolation to calculate an overall sentiment score even though words like “challenging” can be considered to be positive or negative depending on how they are is used in context. Such misclassifications, if enacted in the real world, could have a drastic impact on a teacher’s career and could even lead to what scholars like Baker and Hawn (2022) have called “algorithmic bias” or “algorithmic unfairness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "While our code provides a somewhat exaggerated and simplistic example to illustrate the point that a computational reading of a students’ review might lead to disastrous effects in the absence of human readers’ qualitative contextualization and/or more fair algorithms, it still gestures towards problems that are not entirely imaginary.  For instance, Rajput et al. (2016) argue that general purpose sentiment classifiers often misclassify the sentiment scores of words which may have different contextual meanings in academic settings. For instance, they show how the word “miss” is scored as negative in several general purpose sentiment classifiers which interpret it as referring to a lack or absence, whereas in a educational settings, the word “miss” should mostly be scored as neutral since it often refers simply to a female teacher. Yet others have also also questioned the reliability and validity of such keyword based sentiment analysis algorithms altogether and called for using more robust algorithms like deep learning or neural network algorithms that have more context sensitivity (Lei and Liu, 2019). Due to the black-boxed and proprietary nature of many sentiment analysis softwares that we might come across though, like in learning analytics or qualitative coding programs, we can't always tell what kind of algorithms are being used.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope that this example illustrates how having even a basic understanding of what code does can provide a better understanding of how everyday algorithms impact our lives. With some coding literacy, one can look “under the hood” and see how our code is assigning positive and negative scores and with some practice one could even revise the code to better serve their disciplinary and professional needs. For example, you may want to create a third set of words called neutral_words that could go either way depending on context. Following the rules of positive_words and negative_words and how we ran our function and calculations, it could be possible to draw out more nuanced outcomes, or to establish a more ethical outcome by putting words like “challenging” into a neutral category that requires context-based human scores. Or we could redefine each of our lists completely and get totally different results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, we can see how code has the rhetorical potential to shape our lives – without knowing what is in the list of positive and negative words and what kind of computations they undergo, it is challenging to fully understand what choices are being made by programs like this. We have used this example of performing sentiment analysis to illustrate common vocabulary and syntax in Python. In more advanced practice, you may want to use something longer or more complex as our stand in for the review variable (corpora of student writing, the full text of literary texts like Moby Dick, a series of articles, a collection of harvested content from Reddit, etc.) But the basic principles of performing this kind of analysis carry over into a lot of other domains. How many \"negative\" words are in a sample of a subreddit about US politics offers a second example of sentiment analysis. Calculating the density of whales and boats in Moby Dick compared to whales and boats in scholarly articles about Moby Dick offers a comparison between two corpora. Other examples could be observing hedging words (like “perhaps”) and booster words (like “certainly”) in a corpus of articles in humanities journals and compare those to the density of hedges and boosters a corpus of articles in STEM journals to understand variations in disciplinary rhetorics. Yet others many want to use such computational techniques to help students perform a fine-grained genre analysis of sample texts while introducing them to new genres in writing classes. Of course, these are just illustrative examples, and there are thousands of other ways you can use code to perform different kinds of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Some of them can grow to be quite complicated. But, they use the basic building blocks of computational vocabulary and syntax that we have introduced in this webtext.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be sure, the kind of introductory literacy in Python that our webtext teaches is not intended to magically make you an expert who can start to critically analyze extremely complex algorithms in computer applications around you. However, it can become the starting point for a critical investigation, by enabling you and other digital rhetoricians to collaborate with more advanced practitioners (such as collaborators in disciplines with a more computational trajectory, such as the social sciences, business, computer science, and information science) who work on critically anlayzing and transforming algorithms for greater social good. Knowing how to read the code is half the battle won for being able to comprehend what your collaborators may be doing, and even if you are still not sure about the methods, they can certainly help you understand the why more clearly if you understand the what of the code.\n"

        "\n",
        "Through this webtext, we have provided you with an introductory lesson in computer coding in Python, with some examples of how such a coding literacy can help us engage more critically with the many layers of algorithms in our daily lives. We see a growing interest in coding literacy and computational methods, coming from disciplinary corners including but certainly not limited to information science, computer science, computational social sciences, digital humanities, and digital art history, all converging into a particular space we might want to call “computational approaches to disciplinary objects of inquiry.” The visual rhetoric produced by these disciplinary angles is also interesting and meaningful, and is further ripe for rhetoricians to analyze. For example, work that comes out of the website http://pudding.cool/ provides a wildly successful digital storytelling platform for pulling together interdisciplinary work and research with rhetorical angles on text, visual culture, and social issues. Jeremy Singer-Vine’s weekly *Data is Plural* (2015-present) newsletter similarly provides weekly access to data sets that are ripe and ready for analysis. These are several ways we envision researchers may choose to engage with these concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are interested in more novice-friendly resources for growing code-based literacies, we recommend exploring resources like *The Carpentries* lessons and workshops (Teal et al., 2015) and JSTOR’s *Text Analysis Pedagogy Instititue* materials (JSTOR Labs, 2019-2025)<sup>[7](#fn7)</sup>. There is a large, collaborative, and open-educational community around programming skills, and while we cannot highlight all of them, we especially like the *Programming Historian* and Melanie Walsh’s (2021) *Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python* textbook as solid next steps offering accessible training for someone interested in building next steps and skills. YouTube and online programming courses are also great places to explore. More advanced options include working through O’Reilly’s cookbook series or watching Youtube lectures and/or tutorials<sup>[8](#fn8)</sup>, seeking out data science or programming courses offered across different departments at your university, or attending lectures or workshops on topics like programming, computational analysis, and data science. In addition to more traditional disciplinary homes like Linguistics and Computer Science, the social sciences (sociology, demography, political science, psychology, etc)  and Business have rapidly grown interest in using code in their research and teaching, so it may be worth seeing where these pockets live at your campus. Many university libraries host hands-on training or workshops on coding and they could be another great resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are conscious that we cannot cover every aspect of programming and coding with Python in this short web-text introduction. We wrote this tutorial to provide an on-ramp for novices who want to learn a little about Python and familiarize themselves with the language, but may not be ready (or keen) to produce their own code yet. As we set out to achieve at the beginning of this web-text, we hope that by engaging with our work, you’ve been able to i) experience how computer code in Python works at a micro-scale; ii) develop a basic reading comprehension of computer code in Python; and iii) learn about free, open source resources through which you can continue learning Python for your work.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we plan to expand on this web-text with a followup piece that will provide novices additional on-ramps to performing text and data analysis aimed specifically at the rhetoric, writing, and communication community. As we do this, we continue to be guided by Vee’s (2017) vision, which involves seeing that \"what digital literacies all have in common is computer programming. As a fundamental condition of contemporary writing, programming is the substrate in which these reactions occur; it’s the platform on which they’re constructed. Focusing on programming allows us to see this ecology of digital literacies more fully\" (Vee, 2017, p. 6). We hope that our project helps you see such the digital literacies around you more fully!"
