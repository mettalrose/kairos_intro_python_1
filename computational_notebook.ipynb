        "This webtext is a pedagogical tool that supports students, teachers, and researchers in rhetoric, writing studies, and allied fields who are interested in gaining a beginner-friendly introduction to the computer language Python. Specifically, this webtext consists of a computational notebook, which is a web interface that weaves together multiple modalities of HTML markup, written text, and coding snippets to provide an interactive experience with computer code. The written text in this interface helps users navigate, run, and edit the code snippets and engage with their outputs. By using this webtext, users will develop an ability to read basic code in Python—which is arguably one of the most widely used computer languages today and has played a major role in the development of practices like data science and artificial intelligence, which are rapidly impacting the field of digital rhetoric. Since computer code, especially that which is written in Python, plays a key infrastructural role that undergirds many forms of writing, rhetoric, and culture in our digitally mediated worlds, developing basic literacy in it can enable us to cultivate a critical awareness of our digital lives. You can use this tutorial independently or integrate it into a classroom setting.\n"

        "\n",
        "To make it possible for you to read this sentence, many networks of humans, hardware devices, and computer code are currently working together. Human writers composed and edited this text using a keyboard, which then sent those keystrokes to their computers’ CPU. The CPU then converted those keystrokes into binary data and saved them in the computer’s memory and registered them as visual characters on a screen. The editors of this journal then took that data from the authors, edited it, and saved it on their server. When you clicked on the hyperlink for this page, your computer’s network sent a request to access that data from the journal’s server. After being granted permission, the journal’s server sent the data to your computer. Your computer then converted that binary data into pixels and sent it to your monitor. Finally, your monitor lit up in accordance with protocols on how to display those pixels as visual stimuli, making the text readable to your eyes or your screen readers.\n",
        "Without computer code mediating each of these steps, much modern communication would be unimaginable. This is what Anette Vee alludes to when she talks about the infrastructural role that computer code plays in shaping contemporary communication:\n",
        "\n",
        ">..throughout much of the world, computer code is infrastructural: layered over and under the technology of writing, computer code now structures much of our contemporary communications, including word processing, e-mail, the World Wide Web, social networking, digital video production, and mobile phone technology. Our employment, health records, and citizenship status, once recorded solely in text, are now cataloged in computer databases” (Vee, 2017, p. 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "Many scholars in digital rhetoric have helped us understand that this infrastructural role is not a passive, objective, or neutral form of mediation, but rather it plays an active rhetorical role in shaping meanings in our digital public spheres (e.g., Ingraham, 2014; Beck, 2016; Brock and Shepherd, 2016). For example, Laquintano and Vee (2017) show that fake news can be spread through the use of automated writing algorithms, or ‘bots’ on social media. A bot is any computer program that can automate repetitive tasks typically done by humans. While bots can be used across domains and can be helpful or harmful, Laquintano and Vee (2017) refer to specific kinds of malicious social media bots that are used by their programmers to appear to be real, human users. Such bots can assist in amplifying fake news articles or even just making certain positions seem more legitimate, thereby helping skew public discourse in certain ideological directions. During the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, many social media bots had played an active role in influencing public opinion in this manner (Boichak et al., 2016). To be a mindful social media writer, Laquintano and Vee (2017) argue, it is important to understand what bots are and the infrastructural role that their algorithms play to amplify or constrain different types of discourse. Such knowledge can also help writers generate counter-rhetorical practices. Lussos (2018), for instance, teaches her students how to customize existing coding templates to create Twitter bots that help raise awareness about social problems in the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social media bots are one case, but countless others—like the growing emergence of data science and generative artificial intelligence in our digital lives—have made it important for writers as well as for scholars and teachers of writing and rhetoric to have a basic working knowledge of how computer code shapes their writing and communication. Since rhetoricians broadly practice both critique of existing rhetoric (“rhetorica docens”) and developing mechanisms for production of new rhetoric (“rhetorica utens”) (Jasinski, 2001), learning how to read code can help rhetoricians expand their capacities for both.\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are excellent examples of scholars practising both, that is, rhetoricians who analyse the rhetorical effects of code in our daily lives (Ingraham, 2014; Beck, 2016; Brock and Shepherd, 2016; Lindgren, 2021) as well as rhetoricians who use code to produce a range of rhetorical artifacts (articles in journals like Kairos and the Journal of Writing Analytics being excellent examples), and even though many in the field have advocated for the value of developing coding literacy to do digital rhetorical work (Eyman and Ball, 2014), unfortunately we do not have enough pedagogical resources tailored to onboard new rhetoric scholars, teachers, and writers to read actual computer code that would help them engage more deeply with how code shapes their daily lives and potentially help them use it in their rhetorical creations too. There have been some commendable efforts by digital rhetoricians like Quigley (2022), Lindgren & Ridolfo (2020), and others to create such resources. Our tutorial aims to complement these efforts by providing a novice-friendly and easy-to-use introduction that will help readers develop a basic reading comprehension of computer code in Python. It is important to remember though that the goal of this web text is to assist in basic reading comprehension of Python, not necessarily a level of production-level literacy. We have specifically chosen Python as our language of choice because of its relatively user-friendly syntax and wide applicability, especially in areas of digital writing that interest scholars of writing studies, rhetoric, and allied fields.\n",

        "In what follows, we will begin by introducing  some definitions in Part 3. Then, in part 4, we provide guidance on how to use a computational notebook in Google Colab. In part 5, we move to the meat of the matter and teach you how to read Python code. To do this, we first share sample Python code we created to provide a hypothetical example of how students’ instructor reviews can get analyzed computationally in certain administrative settings. We then explain what is happening in the code through detailed explanations of foundational symbols and concepts in Python. We end this section by reflecting on the kinds of rhetorical and interpretive readings of this code a basic coding literacy would enable for digital rhetoricians. We conclude by offering resources for readers interested in growing these skills further.\n",

        "## Part 3 Some Definitions/What do we talk about when we talk about code?\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Code, Coding, Programming, Computational thinking, and Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, we want to set out some definitions and practices to be clear about what we mean when we talk about “code.” The very first point we would like to make is that all computer code is a form of writing. At the very basic level, computer “code” refers to many different technical languages that have been composed over the last 100-150 years to help human users interact with computers. As rhetoricians, this meaning of “code” is not the only one that we come across in our daily work. Many of us might be more familiar with a different kind of “coding” typically used in qualitative research. In such cases ‘code’ is the identification of, and subsequent execution of, specific content that falls into some kind of classification system or bucket-grouping that provides evidence of a certain kind of outcome<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>. Users develop a ‘code book’ or shared vocabulary of activity to track across multiple sources. This kind of qualitative coding can be done manually, or might require software such as NVivo or Atlas.ti to perform qualitative content analysis or discourse analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to signpost this distinction at the very beginning to avoid confusion between computer coding and qualitative coding. Qualitative data coding is a major methodological intervention in the social sciences and humanistic disciplines. We do not wish to dismiss qualitative analysis - in fact, you can use computer programming languages to perform qualitative analysis. Both definitions of “code” can in fact invoke the use of software or computer programming languages that have certain capacities that provide engagement points between the computer and the user. However, when we discuss code in this piece, we want to be clear that we are using “code” as a shorthand for any text written in a computer language to directly “speak” or “converse” with your computer. Acts of writing such ‘code’ are what are called ‘coding.’ You will often see another term called “programming.” While there are some technical differences that some computer science practitioners tend to differentiate  between the two, for our purposes in this introducotry web-text, we will using the terms “coding” and programming” interchangeably.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next two terms important to introduce here are “computational thinking” and “algorithms.” The first time “computational thinking” (Wing, 2006) is also known as “algorithmic thinking” (Futschek, 2006) or even “proceduracy” (Vee, 2010) in some circles. It refers to overarching set of overlapping skills involves the “ability to analyze a given problem, [...] find basic actions that are adequate to it, construct an algorithm” (Futschek, 2006, p. 160) or a set of well-defined steps or small-procedures that would help solve it, and “then express—or \"write\"—those procedures in a standard format that may be \"read\" by a non-human entity such as a computer” (Vee, 2010, p. 3). Such computational ways of thinking are an essential part of “coding literacy” (Vee, 2017) and can help digital rhetoricians better understand and analyze the rhetorical role that digital media and their underlying substrate of computer code play in the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, computational thinking is a style of thinking that analyzes a given problem and constructs a procedure or an algorithm or a set of steps that would help in solving that problem. When one uses computers to execute those algorithmic steps, then one needs to use technical languages like called computer coding or programming languages which help communicate those steps in a manner that computers can understand. The act of writing those steps in a programming language is what is called coding and the resultant text is what is called code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Our language of choice is the programming language Python. We focus on Python because it opens many opportunities for you to continue to hone your skills as a quantitative and qualitative researcher. Among other things, Python is an open-source, well-maintained programming language with an emphasis on readability<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>.  R, another common open-source programming language, has more of a focus on statistical computing and data visualization<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>. Plenty of Python (and R) materials are already available as open educational resources, and working with computational code in research contributes to the larger open source movement. We like Python because it is lightweight and flexible, and it has the benefit of looking rather like English. This is a general plus for English-language readers and speakers - the code as written should not look intimidating or wildly foreign to us, even if it does not always follow the logic or structure of everyday English language<sup>[4](#fn4)</sup>. This is also a good moment to note that Python is not a natural (i.e. spoken) language, though it has its own internal logic and sets of rules in a way that make it like a spoken language. Additionally, since Python is also widely used by those working with data science and artificial intelligence, we hope that developing a working knowledge of it could also help digital rhetoricians engage more critically with the AI community, which has been marked as an important concern by many scholars of writing studies and rhetoric recently (Gallagher, 2023; Byrd, 2023).  \n",
        "\n",
        "We offer this web-text as a means to introduce the foundations of computer programming in Python that have been adapted for a writing studies audience. Some readers may recall the early days of the personal computer, such as MS-DOS, a predecessor to the modern Windows operating system. Working with Python or other coding languages is very similar to MS-DOS - there is an input screen, and each step to accomplish something must be provided by the user. While this may feel tedious, it also offers the user profound opportunity to be as exact as they want to be—not dissimilar to other forms of composition. Lindgren (2021), in fact, notes that several scholars position code as “the first form of writing that does what it says with great precision” (p. 117). Thus, we find that coding languages offer the ability to be more direct in manipulating data to do precisely what you want while also ensuring greater reproducibility by sharing the exact steps you took to conduct an analysis, including through computational  notebooks like this (more on computational notebooks in the next part) and code repositories such as GitHub. The ability to share, remix, and otherwise adapt extant code is one of the strongest benefits of working with code, along with the capacity for someone to follow along with the steps you took to conduct an analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In what follows, we begin by introducing readers to operating within what is called a “computational notebook,” which hosts and allows users to engage with code in an interactive way. We will offer an overview of how to interact with this notebook, including “running” (i.e. operationalizing) code and observing what it does. Once we establish how to use this resource, we will next introduce the main building blocks of reading Python code. In both instances, we are not seeking to provide a complete dictionary of all ways one may encounter Python, or to cover the large universe of what Python can do, but we do aim to situate our readers with some immediate sense of how to read or otherwise interpret some of the key pieces of Python’s symbols and syntax, which ultimately define different kinds of activities. Much like signposts in prose, these skills-building and vocabulary-building activities are designed to help the reader understand what will happen in the near future.\n",

We spent some time defining what we mean by “code,” “coding,” and “Python” and what our expectations for you, the reader, are. One of the more alien-seeming aspects of interacting with your computer with text in the 2020s is that we have lost a lot of engagement with the “under the hood” model of providing commands. Graphic user interfaces have made it more difficult to see, and subsequently interact with, a command line interface (the black screen that is familiar to coders but everyday users might have only encountered it when their Windows or Mac OS breaks down and need re-installing). For those of you who are used to hardware like a cell phone or a tablet, it can be more difficult to imagine that there is an underlying language to every action you take on your device. However, this is still a crucial piece of computational infrastructure. In this part, we will help you peek under the hood a little bit so let us begin!\n",

What you see below is a sample computer program written in Python code. The goal of this program is to do a rudimentary “sentiment analysis,” which is a popular computational technique used to “systematically detect, extract, and classify the subjective information and affective states expressed in a text, such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions regarding a service, product, person, or topic” (Lei and Liu, 2021, p. 1). Sentiment is typically measured as an overall score attached to a fragment of text, with positive scores indicating “positive” sentiments like good, happy, and favourable (among others) and negative scores indicating “negative” sentiments like bad, sad, and unfavourable (among others). Since the internet is full of trillions of user comments on products, discussion forms, social media and other digital spaces, sentiment analysis has grown to perform a key audience analysis function for businesses, politicians, policymakers, social media moderators, and similar domains.  \n",

The # symbol tells the computer to ignore the immediate sentence after this character and is primarily used to notate a comment or description of what happens in subsequent code for human readers.

This comment offers a summary of what comes next to human readers of the code. What follows next, which looks a lot like a mathematical equation, is what would be called a coding statement and is meant to be processed by the computer. It may look to you like an equation, like in algebra class. Such coding statements can be used for various purposes, most importantly, to define variables, store different types of data in them, and to write functions that perform complex operations on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### B. Variables and Types of Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In algebra, one often writes declarative sentences like “x = 5” to create a variable or placeholder titled “x” and assign it a value of “5” with the equals sign. A lot of computer code follows a similar syntax to create variables where different types of data can be stored. In the example above, we have what appears to be a complete natural sentence, bounded by quotes: “This was an amazing class.” This sentence is preceded by the phrase “student_1_feedback,” and the two are connected by an equals sign. Like in algebra, we are introducing a variable that we are naming “student_1_feedback,” and we are assigning it a certain textual value that is defined by whatever comes after the equals sign. Variables are shorthand for larger amounts of content, so that we can refer to it in our code more easily. We use the equals sign (=) to store this information, so here we are saving the sentence “This was an amazing class” to the variable \"student_1_feedback.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Typing the phrase \"student_1_feedback\" is faster than typing out this entire sentence every time you want to reference it In more advanced code you may find that the variable may be a letter, like “x” in a lot of algebra, or a shorthand abbreviation for a larger name. The way you choose your variable names is entirely up to you, but for ease of memory, you may want to keep them simple and easy to remember. If variable names contain multiple words, you will often see them being connected with the underscore sign (_) rather than a space, because many programming languages do not allow spaces within variable names. This is why we have connected the words “student,” “1,” and “feedback” with underscore signs to create “student_1_feedback” as the variable name in our example.\n",
        "\n",
        "While choosing a variable name is relatively open to a coder’s stylistic preference , other types of syntactic choices, such as  the use of an equals sign (=) when creating variables and storing data in them, are pre-determined by programmers who’ve developed programming languages and cannot be changed. All computer languages use a  pre-defined syntax based on which coding statements become meaningful to computers. Using an equals sign (=) to define variables and store different types of data in them is a syntactical norm that the creators of Python developed. All computing languages use variables for the same purpose, which Bostroem et al. (2016) associate with the image of a sticky note. They write that “assigning a value to a variable is like putting that sticky note on a particular value” (n.p.). But different languages may have different syntax for defining and storing variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python allows us to save a wide range of types of data within variables. For this lesson, we need to learn about two basic types of data in Python: integers and strings. We could save the number “5” in a variable we call “x” and that would be an example of an integer data type. The second datatype called string specifically refers to a string or chunk of textual characters. Such strings often have meanings that are sensible to human readers, or they could be a collection of meaningless, random textual characters too. The sentence that we saved in the variable “student_1_feedback” would be an example of a string. This will become important later because Python determines what kinds of operations can be performed on variables based on the type of data stored in them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have an understanding of variables and the different types of data that can be stored in them, let’s returning to our code above, we have three sentences that we are assigning to the associated variables of “student_1_feedback”, “student_2_feedback”, and “student_3_feedback:”\n",

        "\n",
        "In each of these string variables, we have stored sentences that represent the kind of feedback students sometimes give in feedback survey forms for different classes. This now serves as a dataset that we can perform sentiment analysis on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have this data, the next section of the code accesses a pre-existing software package that will help us do such sentiment analysis.

Like in academic writing, we draw on existing ideas and conversations in our fields (with citations) to build new arguments, programmers often draw on existing code that others have already written. This reduces the need to constantly re-invent the wheel each time someone wants to do something with code. Code reuse is therefore a form of inter-textuality that coders regularly practice. Just like academic ideas are organized into academic journals and books, which are then made available by publishers and through libraries, existing code in Python is organized into packages and subpackages that are released on the internet by various developers, often accompanied by research papers (in journals or conferences) and the actual code and documentation on how to use it (on websites like Github - a popular platform to host and archive software packages). In the example in this exercise, we are using a sentiment analysis package called “vaderSentiment” or “VADER” for short, created by Hutto and Gilbert (2014).\n",

This is a case of (re)use of such software packages. Rather than try to write everything from scratch every time, you will likely see how a common way in which coders work is to first search for existing solutions to coding problems, including searching for similar activities and tasks to see what is available to use for this particular issue. While learning how to read code in Python, thus, it is helpful to understand these different ways in which existing code and documentation about it can be accessed through different entry points. For rhetoricians in particular and academics in general, it is also helpful to contrast such forms of code organization and re-use with how academic articles are distributed and re-used.

A function therefore is a series of commands or coding statements that perform certain actions on a given set of data, and which can be packaged together with a name so that it becomes easier to reuse.

Like formatting a link in an email involves following a set of steps—first, you must highlight the text you want to link; then, add your link to the dialogue box, then, edit the text as needed, and only then do you get your link in the email—a function bundles together a set of steps to achieve the desired outcome. By using pre-existing functions, we can access such procedural bundles that others have created. y installing the software package VADER, and specifically its subpackage “SentimentIntensityAnalyzer,” we now have access to several functions present within it that will allow us to perform sentiment analysis.\n",

        "3. Upon application of the function “polarity scores” to the textual data saved in the variable “student_1_feedback,” many types of sentiment scores will be developed.

We repeat this activity three times, ultimately creating three new variables: student_1_feedback_score, student_2_feedback_score, student_3_feedback_score.

        "Now that it is easier to read what the scores are, let’s now also briefly discuss what the scores mean. As we have established, the compound sentiment score assigns a polarity score on a scale of -1 to 1 to each students’ feedback statement. A score closer to -1 is considered “very negative” and a score closer to 1 is considered “very positive”. A score closer to, or equal to, 0would mean that the text is considered fairly neutral. We may be looking at some of the examples like Student 1’s feedback statement that reads “This was an amazing class” this example and thinking that this is silly, because we can clearly see that student 1’s feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Why would we need a computer to tell us that? The benefits of using computers comes when performing actions at scale- such as for several sections worth of a course’s evaluation or even running an analysis to track patterns in student sentiments for classes over the years. When used at scale, it can be helpful and more useful to see what the aggregated trends/outcomes can be like.\n"

        "Now that you have some familiarity with the concept of coding statements, variables, functions, and software packages, it is helpful to understand a style of thinking that these elements afford called ‘computational thinking.’ So far in this section, we have walked you through the steps of reading and working with sample Python code for assessing how positive or negative a student’s review of a particular teacher was. We helped you interact with the code pieces directly and provided a step-by-step description of each part of the process. We introduced and defined several major components of the Python coding language - variables, data types, functions, and software packages- to illustrate how Python operates with a real-life example. This has the benefit of showing how each ‘sentence’ of the code works, both in a textual and interactive format.\n",

Previously, we had defined “computational thinking” as set of overlapping skills that involve the “ability to analyze a given problem, [...] find basic actions that are adequate to it, construct an algorithm” (Futschek, 2006, p. 160) or a set of well-defined steps or small-procedures that would help solve it, and “then express—or \"write\"—those procedures in a standard format that may be \"read\" by a non-human entity such as a computer” (Vee, 2010, p. 3). In our example, we showed one of the ways in which the problem in front of us—how to analyze student reviews—could be solved computationally. There are many other ways in which different algorithms and coding solutions could’ve been written to address the same problem. Each computational procedure that we chose in our solution, and each line of code that we wrote to implement those procedures, involved rhetorical choices which shaped the results that finally emerged. We discuss this in more detail in the next section below.  \n",

        "### 5.3 Rhetorical Interpretations of Sample Python Code\n",
        "\n",
        "In section 5.1, we used an example of a brief Python program that evaluates student feedback of teachers as positive or negative. In section 5.2 then we produced  with what might be  called a ‘literal’ level reading of the code, a kind of reading that helps readers understand the meaning of foundational symbols and concepts in Python and understand what the coding statements in the coding example command computers to do. Now, we want to expand our reading of the coding example to a broader ‘rhetorical’ level and demonstrate how readings at the ‘literal’ and ‘rhetorical’ levels can complement each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "To read something rhetorically “involves studying carefully some kind of symbolic action, often after the fact of its delivery and irrespective of whether it was actually directed to you or not, so that you might understand it better and appreciate its tactics” (Selzer, 2003, p. 281). Historically, rhetorical actions have been associated with individual human actors and their rhetorical agency, but recent waves of rhetorical scholarship, especially those that draw on new materialist traditions, look at rhetorical actions as being shaped by dispersed and distributed along an assemblage of human and non-human actors and agencies (Cooper, 2011; Miller, 2007) such that the object of rhetorical reading can be “any act, product, process, or artifact” that can function as a symbol and exert influence on people (Bitzer and Black, 1971, qtd. in Zarefsky, 2008). Therefore, the ability to engage with code is an important rhetorical experience because it helps develop a deeper and more holistic understanding of the infrastructures that undergird many modern communication practices.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To read an artifact of computer code rhetorically would imply “making clear the underlying dynamics of the rhetorical work—how it might be seen as influencing people” (Zarefsky, 2008, p. 633).  For Brock (2019), such rhetorical readings of code can be implemented at multiple levels: at the level of the coding statements themselves, at the level of communication that happens between software developers, and at the level of the social and cultural contexts in which code is used by users (p. 12-14). Our particular reading hopes to demonstrate how developing a capacity to read coding statements at a ‘literal’ level, that is at the level of their immediate denotations which usually involve what they command computers to do to certain kinds of data, can enhance our capacity to read them at a ‘rhetorical’ level or at the level of how they influence people. As we’ve argued throughout this text, such a capacity to read code at multiple levels, can help expand rhetoricians capacities for both critique of existing rhetoric and developing mechanisms for production of new rhetoric.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take a moment to look back at the coding example we composed in 5.1 and our step-by-step explanations of coding statements in section 5.2. As we proceed now towards a more rhetorically attuned reading in this section, we ask you to first imagine contexts in which such a piece of code, or what some might call a coding artifact, might actually be used. It would not be too far-fetched to imagine a  button called “sentiment analysis” within a software that automatically collects and assigns a sentiment score to each student feedback for a class at the end of the semester, which then gets sent to administrators tasked with various kinds of program evaluation. Underlying such a button would be computer code - likely more sophisticated than the one we shared in our example for simple illustrative purposes - but possibly relying on similar activities and outcomes.

        "\n",
        "Readers are likely to agree that Example 1 and 2 are generally consistent with what the sentiment analysis has to say: Example 1 is positive and example 2 is negative. However, Example 3 presents a good exampleof what happens when computational logics intersect with how human readers might process meaning differently in different cultural and institutional contexts. Student 3’s feedback (“This was a terribly difficult class but I learnt so much! Can’t thank the teacher enough”) contains words and phrases like “terribly difficult,” and “can’t thank” which on their own seem negative. However, when seen in context, it is equally possible to understand that the student is actually appreciating rather than criticizing the teacher and the class when the full content of the sentence is taken into account. Why then has the sentiment analysis software then calculated this sentence’s overall sentiment to be negative?\n",
        "\n",
        "Going back to the code, we need to first trace the specific software and its associated function that was used to do the sentiment analysis. In section 5.2, we learnt that a specific package called “vadersentiment” was used. While accessing its documentation on Github and in the research paper published by its developers, we find that the composite sentiment score this software allocates to a chunk of text is calculated based on a set of procedures. There isn’t a simple function built into the software itself that would allow us to easily trace these procedures but by reading the documentation that the developers have made available, as well as by using various sample sentences and comparing their sentiment scores, we can make some approximations that help us trace these procedures. On the Github repo, we find the following explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate. (Hutto, 2025, n.p.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, VADER’s sentiment analysis algorithm uses a mixture of two approaches. As Walsh (2021) puts it, VADER “calculates the sentiment of texts by referring to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores as well as by using a handful of simple rules” (n.p.). The first part of this refers to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores. We can think of it as a list of words or phrases with sentiment scores given to each word by human raters. Within Hutto and Gilbert’s (2014) VADER package, these scores range from values between -4 and +4. A word is given a score closer to -4 if a human rater considers it to convey a very negative sentiment, 0 is given if it is considered neutral, and a score closer to +4 is given if it is considered to convey a very positive sentiment. Like the earlier compound scores, this is presented on a scale: so a score of -3 is ‘quite negative’ whereas a score of 1 is ‘kind of positive’. Their process involved 10 human raters rating each word or phrase in their lexicon this way. Then they calculated a mean or average score across the 10 ratings to give an overall sentiment score for each word or phrase in their lexicon.For instance, if the word “terribly” was rated [-3, -3, -3, -2, -2, -3, -3, -2, -2, -3] by their 10 human annotators implying that this word usually carries a largely negative sentiment, and and every time it comes up it receives this aggregate mean sentiment score of -2.6.  For interested readers, the entire lexicon along with the scores given to each word or phrase by the human annotators is available  on Github at this link,https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt, providing an important under-the-hood look at how individual words score and how mixing and matching vocabulary can change the sentiment output.\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER’s developers have attempted to provide an element of qualitative nuance to their sentiment score calculations. Instead of simply summing up all these scores in their lexicon, they also use certain rules to provide a more layered scoring. These rules, which they developed after having two experts “identify properties and characteristics of the text which affect the perceived sentiment intensity of the text” (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014, p. 221) include the following rules: punctuation marks such as  exclamation points, capitalizations, and degree modifiers such as adverbs increase the intensity of the score, conjunctions like “but” and negations like “can’t” change the intensity of the score. For instance, conjunctions like “but” indicate that the sentiment of the text following the conjunction is more dominant, which is implemented by increasing the sentiment score of the words that come after it and reducing the scores of the words that come before it (p. 221). Using this link, one can observe how vocabulary use can affect sentiment scores, but it is also worth remembering that unlike people, computers will always follow the same rules regardless of what you provide them. This has the potential to be beneficial on the user end: computers are always going to be consistent in their application of rules, even if we do not fully agree with every decision underlying the algorithm.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are many interesting things to interpret here. We draw your attention to one of them. According to the rules of the software, the phrase “This was a terribly difficult class” got a negative score of -0.4678. The next phrase “but I learnt so much” should’ve ideally changed that to an overall positive score, especially given the in-built rule in the software that when the conjunction “but” is used, the score of the preceding text should be reduced and that of the succeeding text should be increased. So why didn’t “I learnt so much” get a strong enough positive score? Try running the sentence “I learnt so much” in the coding example above. You might be surprised to see that it leads to a sentiment score of 0.0. This is largely because the word “learnt” is not present in the lexicon of the software! Based on the data collection and annotation processes that the developers of the software followed,  the word “learnt” was not seen to have a very deep sentimental association. However, as teachers and learners, we might disagree because the word “learn” (and by extension its inflections like “learnt”) carries so much emotional meaning for us. Walsh (2021) also notes in her application of this software to fictional texts that it does not always parse through cultural and genre-based nuances, and thus “students and researchers must be careful, cautious, and deliberate when applying sentiment analysis tools to fiction” (n.p).\n",
        "\n",
        "To be sure, Hutto and Gilbert (2014) do discuss in their documentation that their software is primarily built on social media texts, even as they explore its applicability to various other contexts.  It is not the case that the developers of the software intentionally intended to exclude the word “learnt” and by extension the contexts where this word might carry affective connotations important in sentiment analysis.\n",
        "Unlike many commercial software developers, Hutto and Gilbert (2014) have made their software not just available for free but even shared all their code transparently which allows us to read it in such depth. Our reading is thus not a form of intentional criticism, but rather the idea that any code, and by extension any writing technology is always “a sedimented object in which the situated history of its own development—its use cases, ideological underpinnings, etc.—is presupposed in the tool’s design” (Markey et al., 2024, p. 574). Choices baked into the design of an infrastructural artefact can shape our lives in many ways; a rhetorically informed reading of code helps shed light on some of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational scoring of a students’ feedback has the potential to introduce disastrous effects in the absence of human readers’ qualitative contextualization. For instance, Rajput et al. (2016) argue that general purpose sentiment classifiers often misclassify the sentiment scores of words which may have different contextual meanings in academic settings. For instance, they show how the word “miss” is scored as negative in several general purpose sentiment classifiers which interpret it as referring to a lack or absence, whereas in educational settings, the word “miss” should mostly be scored as neutral since it often refers simply to a female teacher. Yet others have also also questioned the reliability and validity of such a keyword based sentiment analysis altogether and called for using more robust algorithms like deep learning or neural network algorithms that have more context sensitivity (Lei and Liu, 2019).\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of a computational procedure such as this one often carry an aura of neutrality, sophistication, and objectivity—which give them immense persuasive power. When we see that a software has calculated the overall sentiment of Student 1’s feedback (“This was an amazing class”) as positive and Student 2’s feedback (“This was a terrible class”) as negative, we might be moved by such computationally augmented claims in certain ways. While these classifications might work well in many contexts, yet as in the case of what we saw with Student 3’s feedback score, any algorithmic procedure always contains within it the possibility of miscaluclations and misclassifications. If enacted in the real world in a misinformed manner, these could have a drastic impact on a teacher’s career and could perhaps lead to what scholars like Baker and Hawn (2022) have called “algorithmic bias” or  “algorithmic unfairness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "So are we arguing against the use of computational tools that do sentiment analysis altogether? Absolutely not - we believe being critically attuned to the necessary rhetorical and coding literacies  to understand what tools can be helpful for, what their limitations can be, and how they can be used in more agentive ways. And we are arguing for greater capacity building for a greater number of rhetoricians to have both training in rhetoric and coding to do such work. For instance, see Gallagher et al.’s (2020) use of sentiment analysis as part of a comprehensive set of “big data audience analysis” techniques that they deploy on a large dataset of 450,000 comments on New York Times articles to produce a set of recommendations on how sentiment analysis procedures can be helpful to flag comments that human moderators can then review. Importantly, they contextualize both the affordance and limitations of the sentiment analysis package they use by providing thoughtful guidance on how its results should be read and potentially implemented while acknowledging those limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope that our example illustrates how having even a basic understanding of what code does can provide a better understanding of how everyday algorithms impact our lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "With some coding literacy, one could look “under the hood” and see how the sentiment analysis softwares we have chosen assigns scores. This informed knowledge could open up new pathways for both critique and critical praxis. For some, such literacy might help both see and consequently show others how code has the rhetorical potential to shape our lives – without knowing what certain coding statements are doing within a software, it is challenging to fully understand what choices are being made by programs like this. For others, who have the time, resources, and interests to dive deeper into exploring computer code in more detail, we could even potentially revise the code to better serve their disciplinary and professional needs. Yet others might want to build coding literacy to be able to have more informed collaborations with colleagues across disciplines who have more advanced literacy in coding and computational methods. For instance, you may want to embark on new kinds of computationally-oriented research projects. You may want to use something longer or more complex as our stand in for the student_feedback variables (corpora of student writing, the full text of literary texts like Moby Dick, a series of articles, a collection of harvested content from Reddit, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "But the basic principles of performing this kind of analysis carry over into a lot of other domains – how many negative words are in a sample of a subreddit about US politics offers a second example of sentiment analysis. Calculating the density of whales and boats in Moby Dick compared to whales and boats in scholarly articles about Moby Dick offers a comparison between two corpora. Other examples could be observing hedging words (like “perhaps”) and booster words (like “certainly”) in a corpus of articles in humanities journals and compare those to the density of hedges and boosters a corpus of articles in STEM journals to understand variations in disciplinary rhetorics. Others may want to use such computational techniques to help students perform a fine-grained genre analysis of sample texts while introducing them to new genres in writing classes. Some others might use these skills to build webtexts and apps that enhance their range of rhetorical expression possibilities, and enable them to publish more in journals like Kairos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even others might analyze how computational techniques are being deployed to influence important decisions in their work contexts. For instance, Kong and Ding (2023) provide a rigorous analysis of the potentials and limitations of computational tools used by employers to screen candidate’s social media data to influence their hiring decisions. Of course, all these are illustrative examples, and there are thousands more ways you can explore code to perform different kinds of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Some of them can grow to be quite complicated. But, they use the basic building blocks of computational vocabulary and syntax that we have introduced in this webtext.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be sure, the kind of introductory literacy in Python that our webtext teaches is not intended to magically make you an expert who can immediately write and read extremely complex code around you. However, it can become the starting point for a critical investigation, and enable you and other digital rhetoricians to collaborate with more advanced practitioners (such as collaborators in disciplines with a more computational trajectory, such as the social sciences, business, computer science, and information science) who work on critically anlayzing and transforming algorithms for greater social good. Knowing how to read the code is half the battle for being able to comprehend what your collaborators may be doing, and even if you are still not sure about the methods, they can certainly help you understand the why more clearly if you understand the what of the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "Through this webtext, we have provided an introductory lesson in computer coding in Python, with some examples of how such coding literacy can help us engage more critically with the many layers of code in our daily lives. We wrote this tutorial to provide an on-ramp for novices who want to learn a little about Python and familiarize themselves with the language, but may not be ready (or keen) to produce their own code yet. As we set out to achieve at the beginning of this web-text, we hope that by engaging with our work, you’ve been able to i) experience how computer code in Python works at a micro-scale; ii) develop a basic reading comprehension of computer code in Python; and iii) learn about free, open source resources through which you can continue learning Python for your work. We hope that our own examples help inspire you. We are conscious that we cannot cover every aspect of coding with Python in this short web-text introduction. Thus, in this final section, we now provide a range of resources that we have found helpful in our journey of learning how to code as humanists and rhetoricians which we hope to provide many options for you to explore too.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a rhetoric, writing, and technical communication scholar (Anuj) and a digital scholarship librarian with a background in literary studies (Heather), we do not have formal degrees in computer science. Despite this, our interests, graduate coursework and research, pass-time tinkering, attending workshops, collaborations, and through the generosity of many coders who freely share their resources online, we have developed some facility in reading and writing with code. By no means do we see ourselves as experts, but rather as tinkerers who continue to learn and grow. What follows now are some of the pathways to learning code that we have engaged with and would like to briefly discuss for interested readers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together we see a growing interest in coding literacy and computational methods, coming from disciplinary corners including but certainly not limited to information science, computer science, computational social sciences, digital humanities, and digital art history, all converging into a particular space we might want to call “computational approaches to disciplinary objects of inquiry.” To look at some beginner-friendly examples of what scholarly writing that utilizes these kind of techniques, work that comes out of the website http://pudding.cool/ provides a wildly successful digital storytelling platform for pulling together interdisciplinary work and research with rhetorical angles on text, visual culture, and social issues that readers of Kairos would naturally be interested in. If you are interested in looking at various kinds of datasets that could be used for computationally oriented projects, Jeremy Singer-Vine’s weekly Data is Plural (2015-present) newsletter similarly provides weekly suggestions to data sets that are ripe and ready for analysis. All of these resources provide many affordances for both critique as well as critical praxis that rhetoricians may be interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are interested in more novice-friendly resources for growing code-based literacies, we recommend exploring resources like The Carpentries lessons and workshops (Teal et al., 2015) and JSTOR’s Text Analysis Pedagogy materials (JSTOR Labs, 2019-2025). There is a large, collaborative, and open-educational community around programming skills, and while we cannot highlight all of them, we especially like the Programming Historian and Melanie Walsh’s (2021) Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python textbook as solid next steps offering accessible training for someone interested in building next steps and skills. YouTube and online programming courses are also great places to explore. More advanced options include working through O’Reilly’s cookbook series or watching Youtube lectures and/or tutorials, seeking out data science or programming courses offered across different departments at your university, or attending lectures or workshops on topics like programming, computational analysis, and data science. In addition to more traditional disciplinary homes like Linguistics and Computer Science, the social sciences (sociology, demography, political science, psychology, etc)  and Business have rapidly grown interest in using code in their research and teaching, so it may be worth seeing where these pockets live at your campus. Many university libraries host hands-on training or workshops on code skills and they could be another great resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from these pathways to learn coding, you may have encountered discussions about how generative AI intersects with code literacy and training. For instance, you may have come across social media statements from computer scientists like Andrej Karpathy who’ve argued that “the hottest new programming language is English” (Karpathy, 2023; see also Huang qtd. in Petraues, 2024), or opinion pieces with headlines like “The End of Programming” (Welsh, 2023), or the “End of Computer Programming as We Know It” (Manjoo, 2023). The use of GenAI tools to augment coding has been called “vibecoding” where “you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists” (Karpathy, 2025). Some versions of this idea have had significant uptake on social media with many now wondering if all forms of traditional coding education are obsolete, because generative AI tools can produce large stretches of code in many programming languages in response to human commands written in English called “GenAI prompts” (Gupta and Shivers-McNair, 2024). While discussing “vibe-coding” in detail is outside the scope of the current web-text, we do want to briefly address concerns that some of our readers may have about the value of spending time and resources to build foundational literacy in coding in Python at a historical moment when they may be hearing arguments that such a literacy is growingly becoming obsolete.\n",
        "\n",
        "We believe that a foundational literacy in reading computer code becomes even more important in the age of generative AI for rhetoricians. Emerging evidence on the use of GenAI in coding in both professional and educational settings is mixed. On the one hand, researchers have found that using such resources can enhance productivity for professional coders and help onboard novice coders through greater accessibility, personalisation, and engagement when appropriate scaffolding is provided. Simultaneously, there is also growing evidence that over-reliance and over-use of GenAI can inhibit novice coders from developing the critical thinking skills important for doing computational thinking. Such over-use can also homogenize the range of algorithms humans typically develop to solve computational problems, which could lead to security vulnerabilities in code that powers software that millions of people use everyday (Jost et al., 2024; Sarkar, 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Qiao et al., 2025; Deriba et al., 2025). An important insight we draw from this emerging evidence is thus that even for users who may wish to use GenAI for coding tasks, a foundational literacy in reading computer code is not just beneficial, but perhaps also crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "This emerging evidence also tracks with our own personal experiences. Now that Anuj has foundational literacy in coding, he has found that using GenAI tools has expanded his capacity to understand and use new coding packages, opening up new rhetorical possibilities for him. Yet, he has also noticed that when these tools do make errors or produce unfavorable outputs, his foundational literacy in coding becomes even more important to troubleshoot and find alternate pathways to achieve his goals. Heather has found that learning new skills is easier when you’re not trying to learn it all at once, but starting with a small puzzle you need to solve first before moving on to the next thing, thus building confidence slowly through continued exposure. Thus, building coding literacy in languages like Python becomes even more important in the age of GenAI, both for rhetoricians interested in critiquing these emerging tools as well as for those interested in using them to augment their coding workflows in a critically informed manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope that our webtext as well as the range of resources and pathways we have discussed in this section for future exploration have sparked your curiosity and inspired you to explore code in Python in more depth. To support your journey, we hope to expand on the current web-text with follow-up pieces that provide additional onramps to more advanced coding techniques specifically for text and data analysis aimed at the rhetoric, writing, and communication community. We also hope to discuss the growing impact of GenAI on coding, especially the phenomenon of “vibe-coding,” in more depth in future peices. As we do this, we continue to be guided by Vee’s (2017) vision, which involves seeing that \"what digital literacies all have in common is computer programming. As a fundamental condition of contemporary writing, programming is the substrate in which these reactions occur; it’s the platform on which they’re constructed. Focusing on programming allows us to see this ecology of digital literacies more fully\" (Vee, 2017, p. 6). We hope that our web-text has helped you see such the digital literacies around you more fully!\n"
